If you've made changes within a submodule and you want to commit those changes, follow these steps:

Navigate to the Submodule Directory:
Change your working directory to the submodule where you've made changes.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/submodule
Review and Stage Changes:
Use standard Git commands to review your changes and stage them for commit.

bash
Copy code
# Review changes
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Optionally, review the changes again
git status
Commit Changes:
Commit the changes within the submodule.

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Navigate Back to the Main Project:
Move back to your main project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd ..
Commit the Submodule Reference in the Main Project:
The main project needs to know about the commit you made in the submodule. Commit the updated submodule reference.

bash
Copy code
git add path/to/submodule
git commit -m "Update submodule to latest commit"
This step is essential because it updates the reference in your main project to point to the specific commit in the submodule where you made changes.

Push Changes:
If you want to push your changes to a remote repository, don't forget to push both the submodule and the main project.

bash
Copy code
# Push submodule changes
cd path/to/submodule
git push

# Push main project changes
cd ..
git push
